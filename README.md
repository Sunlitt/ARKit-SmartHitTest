I found a very useful function in one of Apple's Demos that I think needs to be accessed easier.

It was found inside the downloadable project on the following page:
https://developer.apple.com/documentation/arkit/handling_3d_interaction_and_ui_controls_in_augmented_reality

I've added the license from that project to this repository.

I DID NOT MAKE THIS FUNCTION, JUST WANTED TO PACKAGE IT UP SO I AND OTHERS CAN USE IT EASILY.
